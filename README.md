# Dynamic-Web-Portal-using-Servlets-JDBC
## **Abstract:**

This project focuses on the development of a dynamic and interactive web portal using Java Servlets and JDBC. It is designed to bridge the gap between frontend user interfaces and backend database operations. The core functionality of this web portal lies in its ability to handle real-time data processing through server-side Java components while maintaining a strong connection to a relational database (MySQL) using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).

The system includes modules such as user registration and storage of details in the database, showcasing how real-world applications maintain user records. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to separate concerns and improve modularity, making the system robust, scalable, and easy to maintain.

###  **Objective:**

* To create a dynamic web portal using Java-based technologies.
* To implement user interaction and data storage using Servlets and JDBC.
* To understand the architecture and flow of a database-driven web application.
* To apply MVC pattern principles in a Java EE-based project.
* To demonstrate form handling, validation, and server response.

###  **System Requirements:**

* **Operating System**: Windows / Linux / macOS
* **Backend Language**: Java (JDK 8 or higher)
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap Optional), JSP
* **Web Server**: Apache Tomcat 9+
* **Database**: MySQL
* **IDE**: Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
* **Browser**: Chrome / Firefox / Edge

###  **Functional Modules:**

1. **Home Page**: Displays basic information and navigation to other pages.
2. **User Registration**: Allows new users to input name, email, and password.
3. **Servlet Handler**: Accepts form data, processes it, and connects with the database.
4. **Database Layer**: Stores and retrieves data using MySQL with JDBC.
5. **Validation & Feedback**: Provides user feedback after form submission.


###  **Working Procedure:**

1. The user visits the registration page and submits their details.
2. The form data is sent to a Java Servlet using the POST method.
3. The Servlet retrieves form fields, connects to the database using JDBC, and stores the data.
4. Based on the operation result, a success or failure message is shown to the user.
5. Data is stored in a MySQL table for later use (e.g., login, admin view, etc.).

### **Architecture Overview (MVC):**

* **Model**: `DBConnection.java` and database schema (MySQL)
* **View**: `register.html`, `index.jsp` (user interface)
* **Controller**: `RegisterServlet.java` (handles logic and communication)

###  **Key Features:**

* Clean and responsive UI
* Data persistence via JDBC
* Centralized configuration using Servlet annotations or web.xml
* Code modularity through separation of concerns
* Scalable architecture for extending features like login, search, and CRUD operations

###  **Security Considerations:**

* Input validation on both client and server side
* Prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
* Can be extended to include session handling and user authentication

###  **Scope for Future Enhancements:**

* Add **Login & Authentication** functionality
* Create a **Dashboard** to view registered users
* Implement **Session Management** using `HttpSession`
* Add **Admin Panel** for user management
* Use JSPs for dynamic page rendering
* Integrate **AJAX** or **REST APIs** for better UX
* Apply **Encryption** for passwords (e.g., using SHA-256 or BCrypt)
* Deploy on **cloud platforms** like Heroku or AWS
